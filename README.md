<h1>Simon Game</h1>

<p>Simon Game is a fun project that I built around August last year with vanilla javascript. The game randomly flashes one of four colored boxes, expecting you to click on the boxes get the sequence correctly (i.e in the order that the boxes were flashed).</p>

<p>For example, when the game flashes the first box, say a red box, you are expected to click on the red box to keep playing. Afterwards the game flashes another box, say a blue box. This time, you are expected to click on the red box AND then the blue box. After that, the game flashes another box and expects you to click on three boxes in the order that they were flashed. If a box is flashed in succession, you click for each time it was flashed.</p>

<p>So... <i>happy playing!</i></p>
